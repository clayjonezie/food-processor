<h2>about</h2>
<p>
This is Clay Jones' senior project for his Computer Science degree at California Polytechnic State University. 
</p>
<h2>problem</h2>
<p>It is an insightful health practice but not a technical challenge to simply record all the food a patient eats. 
However, there are many ways to improve the patient's likelihood to record all food, quality of the data, 
and quality of the advice provided. Existing solutions lack customization, 
were designed on outdated nutrition practices, have suboptimal user interfaces, and lack clinical application. 
</p><p>
It is a meticulous process to enter the nutrition info of every single thing you eat, 
especially when following a diet that is low in commercially prepared foods (perhaps lacking labels or brand names). 
We are asking patients to take a small amount of time every time they eat to enter this data. 
This leads to patients forgetting or quitting the food tracking habit. 
</p><p>
Technology can be employed to assist with this. 
</p>

<h2>for testers</h2>
<p>
Please contact me for a testing account. Your data will be used by the system and visible to developers (myself).
No other users will be able to see your food log. I do my best to backup all data but this project is a work in progress
and highly unstable.
